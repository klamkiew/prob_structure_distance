# Probable Structure Distance
The goal of this project is to compare two RNA sequences regarding their evolutionary distances, but taking RNA secondary struture into account.

## Task 01
Run RNAfold on two synthetic RNA sequences and compute their base pairing probability matrixes

## Task 02
Parse the PostScript files and obtain the base pairing probabilities for further analysis

## Task 03
Repeat this process with small RNAs from phages that are described by Chevallereau et al. (2016)
